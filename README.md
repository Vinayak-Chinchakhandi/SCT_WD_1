## Features

- **Fixed Navigation Bar:**  
  The navigation bar stays fixed at the top and changes background color when the user scrolls down the page for better visibility.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Works seamlessly across devices and screen sizes, adjusting layout and navigation for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

- **Mobile Hamburger Menu:**  
  On small screens, the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu. Clicking the hamburger opens a full-screen overlay menu with vertical navigation links that have hover and focus effects.

- **Hero Section with Split Layout:**  
  The hero area features text content on the left and space reserved for an image on the right, adapting to smaller screens by stacking vertically.

- **Content Sections:**  
  Includes featured destinations, experiences, reasons to choose Wanderly, traveler testimonials, and a contact form.

- **Smooth Hover & Focus Transitions:**  
  Buttons, links, cards, testimonials, and form inputs feature smooth hover and focus transitions for an interactive, polished user experience.
